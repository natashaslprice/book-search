<strong>NEXT BOOK</strong>

Built 22nd - 29th October 2015

First full app built after 4 weeks of coding.

Next Book is an app for book lovers to help them find their next books.
It provides lists of the latest best-sellers and has a search engine based on author
name or book title. Recommendations are provided based on books that users
have read and enjoyed. A personal to-read list helps users keep track of books
that they would like to read in the future.

You can view Next Book on [Heroku](https://next-book.herokuapp.com).

User Stories:

reading one. I want the ability to find good books quickly and easily.
- My name is Lesley and I want the ability to search for books by authors I like.
- My name is Chris and I read really fast. I want to find more books quickly,
which I know I'll enjoy because other people who have read the same books as me
have also read and enjoyed them.
