<strong>NEXT BOOK</strong>

Built 22nd - 29th October 2015

First full app built after 4 weeks of coding

Next Book is an app for book lovers to help them find their next books. 
It provides lists of the latest best-sellers and has a search engine based on author 
name or book title. Recommendations are provided based on books that users 
have read and enjoyed. A personal to-read list helps users keep track of books
that they would like to read in the future.

User Stories:

1. My name is Natasha and I always struggle to choose a new book once I have finished 
reading one. I want the ability to find good books quickly and easily.

2. My name is Lesley and I want the ability to search for books by authors I like.

3. My name is Chris and I read really fast. I want to find more books quickly, 
which I know I'll enjoy because other people who have read the same books as me 
have also read and enjoyed them.

4. My name is Edd and I like lists. I want to have a list of books that I want 
to read in the future.
